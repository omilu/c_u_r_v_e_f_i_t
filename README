This script formats the A and B dat files so they can be plotted
in GNUPLOT and curve fit to find the characteristic curve for the
detectors.

Step1.  Extract the A and B data from the log file using testgrafix>fileover>export excel
Step2.  There will be to CSV files one for A and one for B.  They must have
names of the form *A.dat and *B.dat
Step3.  Put the dat files in teh same directory as makeplot.scr
Step4.  Run makeplot.scr
Step5.  This will process the data making a newfile called plba
	that contains the minA for each B
Step6.  Gnuplot should start automatically, type load 'plot.plt'
	to do the curve fit. depending on the data you may need
	to change the range for the curve fit
	fit [from:to' f(x) "plba" via a2, a1, a0
	the coefficients will be stored in the logfile
